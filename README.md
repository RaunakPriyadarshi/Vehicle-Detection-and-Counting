Vehicle Detection and Counting System:

This project detects and counts vehicles in a video feed using computer vision techniques. It tracks vehicles crossing a predefined line and distinguishes between those moving toward or away from the camera. Using background subtraction and centroid tracking, the system logs vehicle counts with timestamps to an Excel file at regular intervals. This solution is implemented with OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas, and can be easily customized for different video inputs and scenarios.
